In fact, we even know that squatting before doing curls has been shown to significantly improve arm strength!"

In fact, one scientific study found a nearly 18-percent greater improvement in squat 1RM after following an Olympic-based program compared to a traditional powerlifting program."

Because the leg press recruits less muscle mass than squats, it simply doesn't generate the same degree of testosterone release.[6] Nor is the body position here particularly functional, unless your log cabin collapses and your only way out is pushing the timber forward."

Plus, most hamstring routines focus on leg-curl movements, which center around the knee joint, but this one works from the hip joint. It's vastly underutilized in most trainees' workouts, another reason we believe it's a good fit."
